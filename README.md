# I'm Tung

## What I care about
- .NET ecosystem.
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Event-driven & microservices systems
- Cloud-native architecture
- Long-term system evolution

DDD isn’t just a pattern for me — it’s a **way of thinking** about software.

## Let’s connect
- Open to discussions on architecture, DDD, and system design
